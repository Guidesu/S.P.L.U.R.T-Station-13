## MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_DELAY 2.10
WALK_DELAY 7.15

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types. THIS AFFECTS ALL SUBTYPES OF THE TYPE YOU CHOOSE!
## Entries completely override all subtypes. Later entries have precedence over earlier entries.
## This means if you put /mob 0 on the last entry, it will null out all changes, while if you put /mob as the first entry and
## /mob/living/carbon/human on the last entry, the last entry will override the first.
MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien -0.5
MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien/humanoid/sentinel -0.75
MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien/humanoid/drone -0.5
MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien/humanoid/royal/praetorian 2
MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien/humanoid/royal/queen 4
